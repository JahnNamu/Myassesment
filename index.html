            <p>​​​​​​​The Te Reo name gifted to the College is Te Waka Whakapono, literally,<br> the Faith Waka/Boat. Catholic Cathedral College is located within the takiwā<br> of Ngāi Tūāhuriri, the primary hapū Ngāi Tahu who hold mana whenua over <br>  Christchurch City , in an area centred on Tuahiwi in North Canterbury and <br>extending from the Hurunui River to the Hakatere/Ashburton River and inland <br>to the Main Divide.
            The traditions of Waitaha, Ngāti Māmoe and Ngāi Tahu were <br> embedded in the landscape by Ngāi Tahu over an 800-year period. Since 1830, <br>Ngāi Tahu have welcomed all people to our lands and held true to the values instilled <br> in the proverb, ‘kia atawhai ki te iwi’ / ‘Care for the people’. This whakataukī was <br> expressed about the settler population in Christchurch by Pita Te Hori, the first Ūpoko <br> Rūnanga of Ngāi Tūāhuriri in 1861. This founding kaupapa was laid by Tūāhuriri, the ancestor <br> after which the hapū of Ngāi Tūāhuriri takes its name. Today, Ngāi Tūāhuriri continue to <br>uphold these values when welcoming all those who now call Ōtāutahi/Christchurch home — <br>no matter where you have come from. -  <a href="https://www.cathcollege.school.nz/about/our-history" target="_blank">click for more info</a></p>

            <p>In the 1850s due to labour shortages the longstanding opposition to immigration <br> of Irish Catholics was abandoned and Irish Catholics quickly came to make up a <br>significant proportion of the working class in Christchurch. In 1857 the Crown allotted <br> the Catholic Church a plot of land at the corner of Ferry Road and Barbadoes Street, <br>at the heart of the Irish working-class suburbs, in order that the recently arrived Marist <br>missionary priests could begin serving their spiritual needs.

            A chapel and a  modest <br> parsonage opened on the Barbadoes Street site in 1860, although the land was low-lying and initially <br> poorly drained and subject to flooding. Over time the city’s drainage improved. <br> A beautiful gothic wooden Church of the Blessed Sacrament, designed by Benjamin Mountfort was <br>built in 1864, replacing the original chapel.
